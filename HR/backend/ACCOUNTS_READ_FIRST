First user becomes admin (already enabled)

I wired the backend so the very first user created in an empty DB is automatically assigned role=admin.
Steps:
Start with a clean DB (no rows in users).

Start the server and go to /register.

Create your account. You’ll be signed in as admin.

Confirm via GET /api/v1/me → role: "admin".

After that, you can create other users and change roles in Swagger (/docs → POST /api/v1/admin/users/role-by-email).

Temporary env-based admin (fallback if DB isn’t empty)

#####
USERS Also assigned the role of "HRM Admin" are able to view so change roles to that
Also Templates doesnt matter but still there can remove
#####

If you don’t want to wipe the DB, you can temporarily mark an account as admin via environment:
ADMIN_EMAILS="owner@example.com" or ADMIN_DOMAIN="example.com" ADD TO .env
Restart the server so the env takes effect, log in as that user, then use:
POST /api/v1/admin/users/role-by-email with role=admin to persist the DB role.
Remove the env var and restart once you’ve got at least one DB admin.
HRM Admin via role

If you only need HRM Admin capabilities (Applicants/Workers), set the user’s Candidate ROLE (job_title) to "HRM Admin" or assign DB role hrm_admin using the same by-email endpoint.
